This folder contains the complete set of Jupyter Notebook files and trained models required to run and reproduce
the HybridPINNs framework. Unlike PurePINNs, the HybridPINNs approach incorporates sparse CFD data along with physical 
constraints during the training process to further enhance accuracy and convergence.

1. LIDReHybridPINNs.ipynb — Model Training Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook is used to train the HybridPINNs model.
Users can modify various hyperparameters, including learning rate, network depth, number of neurons, batch size, and 
number of epochs.
The training process utilizes a combination of:
Physics-based constraints from the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, and
Sparse CFD-generated data, which guides the model toward improved accuracy and faster convergence.
This hybrid strategy combines the advantages of data-driven learning and physics-based modeling.

2. LIDReHybridPINNs.keras — Pre-trained Model
This file contains a pre-trained HybridPINNs model saved in Keras format.
The model has already been trained using sparse CFD data and physical constraints.
Users can directly load this model to obtain predictions without retraining.
The trained network predicts velocity and pressure fields for a wide range of Reynolds numbers.

3. Load_Model_HybridPINNs.ipynb — Model Loading and Prediction Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook is used to load the pre-trained model (LIDReHybridPINNs.keras) and perform predictions.
It demonstrates how to load the trained model.
The notebook computes and visualizes the HybridPINNs-based predictions, including velocity components and pressure fields.
This file is useful for quick testing, validation, and visualization of results.

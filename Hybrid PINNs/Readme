This folder contains Jupyter Notebook file for the HybridPINNs.
We refer it as Hybrid PINNs as it needs sparse CFD data in the trainning process.
It solves the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. 
Instead of training the model for one specific flow case, 
the network is trained to learn a general solution that works across many flow conditions. 
The results generated using this code are reported in the paper
“A Parameterized Physics-Informed Neural Network Solver for the Navier–Stokes Equations Across Reynolds Numbers”,
Which is available on arXiv: arXiv:2602.04670 and is being prepared for submission to Physics of Fluids.

This folder contains the complete set of Jupyter Notebook files and trained models required to run 
and reproduce the PurePINNs framework.

1. LIDRePurePINNs.ipynb — Model Training Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook is used to train the PurePINNs model from scratch.
Users can modify various hyperparameters, such as learning rate, network architecture, number of layers,
number of neurons,batch size, and training epochs.
The notebook allows users to customize the training process according to their computational resources and 
accuracy requirements.
This notebook is intended for users who wish to train their own models, experiment with different configurations, 
or extend the method to other flow configurations.

2. LIDRePurePINNs.keras — Pre-trained Model
This file contains a pre-trained PurePINNs model saved in Keras format.
The model has already been trained using the methodology described in the paper.
Users who do not want to spend time or computational resources on training can directly load this model.
The trained network can predict velocity and pressure fields for a wide range of Reynolds numbers.

3. Load_Model_PurePINNs.ipynb — Model Loading and Prediction Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook is used to load the pre-trained model (LIDRePurePINNs.keras) and perform predictions.
It demonstrates how to load the trained network.
The notebook computes the predicted flow fields and visualizes the PINNs-based results, such as velocity components
and pressure distribution.
This file is particularly useful for quick testing, validation, and demonstration purposes.

# Parametric-PINNs-for-Navier-Stokes
This repository contains code for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Instead of training the model for one specific flow case, the network is trained to learn a general solution that works across many flow conditions.
The results generated using this code are reported in the paper
“A Parameterized Physics-Informed Neural Network Solver for the Navier–Stokes Equations Across Reynolds Numbers”, which is available on arXiv: arXiv:2602.04670 and is being prepared for submission to Physics of Fluids.
